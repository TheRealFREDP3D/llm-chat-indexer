      "summary": "The improved Three.js snake game features a clear code structure with separate functions for various tasks, including scene setup, snake and food creation, collision detection, and a game loop. The AI is driven by a simplified A* pathfinding algorithm that guides the snake towards food while avoiding collisions, with basic stuck handling. The game uses Three.js best practices such as THREE.Group for snake segments and efficient mesh updates. Key features include robust collision detection, proper food placement, game over functionality, score tracking, window resizing, and smooth snake movement. The AI implementation is basic and can be improved further using complete A* Algorithm, wall following algorithm, Genetic Algorithm/Reinforcement Learning and Lookahead. Further improvements can be made such as Optimize Collision Detection, GUI, Obstacles, Multiple Food Items, Different Snake Colors, Level Design and Power-Ups.",

The cheat sheet covers installation, basic setup, connecting to remote targets, sending and receiving data, packing and unpacking, shellcode generation, debugging, exploitation helpers like ROP chains and ELF parsing, format string exploits, and utility functions. It's intended as a quick reference, with a recommendation to consult the official documentation for advanced usage.",

      "summary": "The conversation outlines different types of context used by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses. These include immediate context (token window), session context (conversation history within a single session), persistent context (long-term memory across conversations), external context (user-provided data like documents or databases), and prompt engineering context (structure and instructions within the prompt itself). Newer models handle longer contexts more effectively, and while session context is lost after a reset, persistent context and external context enable more personalized and factually accurate responses.",

It details the installation process, including cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, configuring the environment with an LLM API key via the `.env` file, and running the tool with `python chat-indexer.py`. By default, the tool scans the current directory for chat files, processes them, extracts topics and summaries using the configured LLM, and generates a JSON index and markdown summary in the `./output` directory. Configuration can be done through the `.env` file or environment variables.",
